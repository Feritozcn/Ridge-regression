# Ridge Regression Model for Data Prediction

This repository contains Python code that implements a **Ridge Regression** model to predict the relationship between two features (`info1` and `info2`) and the target variable (`results`). The model is trained on a dataset, and predictions are made for both the training and testing sets.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run this code:
- `pandas` (for data handling)
- `numpy` (for numerical computations)
- `matplotlib` (for data visualization)
- `sklearn` (for machine learning utilities)

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
